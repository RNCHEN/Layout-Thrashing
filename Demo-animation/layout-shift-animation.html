        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>This demo shows how animations can cause layout shifts and affect performance.</p>
        <p>In this example, the <code>.box</code> element is animated to move from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the viewport. This movement causes a layout shift.</p>
        <p>The animation triggers layout and paint steps in the browser's rendering pipeline, which are more expensive than animating properties like <code>transform</code> and <code>opacity</code> that only affect compositing.</p>
        <p>Animating properties that affect layout or paint can lead to performance issues and a less smooth experience, as the browser has to recalculate the geometry and repaint the affected elements.</p>
        <p>For optimal performance, it's recommended to animate properties that only affect compositing, such as <code>transform</code> and <code>opacity</code>, to achieve smoother animations and avoid layout shifts.</p>
